My name is Jake Buzhardt and I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Chemical & Biological Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, working with [Prof. Michael D. Graham](https://grahamgroup.che.wisc.edu/). 

I completed my PhD in Mechanical Engineering in 2023 at Clemson University, where I worked with Phanindra Tallapragada in the [Applied Dynamical Systems Lab](http://ptallap.people.clemson.edu/).

Broadly, my research interests are the modeling and control of nonlinear dynamical systems.  My current work is focused on data-driven methods for reduced order modeling in fluid dynamics applications.   In my PhD work, particular applications that I studied include the control of offroad vehicles and the control of groups of interacting microswimming robots.  Within these contexts, I have studied problems of parameter estimation, trajectory optimization, deep reinforcement learning, among others.  I am also particularly interested in data-driven modeling and control strategies based on finite dimensional approximations of the Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators.
