My name is Jake Buzhardt, and I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Chemical & Biological Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, working with [Prof. Michael D. Graham](https://grahamgroup.che.wisc.edu/). 

I completed my PhD in Mechanical Engineering in 2023 at Clemson University, where I worked with Phanindra Tallapragada in the [Applied Dynamical Systems Lab](http://ptallap.people.clemson.edu/).

Broadly, my research interests are the modeling and control of nonlinear dynamical systems.  My current work is focused on data-driven methods for reduced order modeling in fluid dynamics applications. During my PhD, I worked on applications such as the control of groups of interacting microswimming robots and the control of offroad vehicles.  Within these contexts, I have studied problems of data-driven and uncertainty-aware control, parameter estimation, trajectory optimization, and deep reinforcement learning  I am also particularly interested in data-driven modeling and control strategies based on finite dimensional approximations of the Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators.
