My name is Jake Buzhardt and I am a PhD student in the [Mechanical Engineering Department](http://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/me/) at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/).  

I am advised by [Phanindra Tallapragada](http://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/me/people/faculty/tallapragada.html) in the [Applied Dynamical Systems Lab](http://ptallap.people.clemson.edu/).

Broadly, my research interests are the modeling and control of nonlinear dynamical systems for robotic locomotion.  Particular applications that I have studied include the control of offroad vehicles and the control of groups of interacting microswimming robots.  Within this context, I have studied problems of parameter estimation, trajectory optimization, deep reinforcement learning, among others.  More recently, my work has focused on data-driven modeling and control strategies based on finite dimensional approximations of the Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators.  In particular, I am interested in methods which account for the uncertainty that arises in the approximation of these operators or uncertainty that is inherent to the system or available measurements.
