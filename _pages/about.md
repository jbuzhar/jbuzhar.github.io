My name is Jake Buzhardt and I am a PhD student in the [Mechanical Engineering Department](http://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/me/) at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/).  

I am advised by [Phanindra Tallapragada](http://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/me/people/faculty/tallapragada.html) in the [Applied Dynamical Systems Lab](http://ptallap.people.clemson.edu/).

My primary research interests are modeling and control of nonlinear dynamical systems.  Particular applications that I have studied include the control of offroad vehicles and the control of groups of interacting microswimming robots.

The best way to reach me is by email:  jbuzhar [at] clemson.edu
